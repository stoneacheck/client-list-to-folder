client-list-to-folder
=====================

I cobbled this AppleScript together from various snippets and fooling around on the web.  I hope someone else finds this useful.  I apologize in advance if anyone is pissed I copied some code, it was thrown together over a few heavy googling sessions.

Requirements:

Mac OS X
Microsoft Excel for Mac

Tested on 10.8.2 and Office 2011

I have chosen to include the file as a script, you can open it in AppleScript Editor and save it as an application to make it runnable.

Feel free to email michaelstonacek at gmail with any questions or suggestions.
